## Todo App - Postgres (Full Stack App)

### Lab

Since this is our last class, I just want you to create your own database called todos on ElephantSQL.
You will use the URL they give you (reviewed in class) and put it in the .env file. 

This will give you a working Todos App that stores all of the todos in our Postgres database and not in our node memory (in our sever) or React state (like earlier iterations).

I will go through everything in this working app together with you, so make sure you clone it, and install the dependencies (npm install).

This Todo app does everything, BUT deletes a todo.

### Homework (due May 10th)

All you have to do is add delete functionality to the app. Just follow the patterns that have been done for you for the reading, and editing functionality that we have reviewed together in lab.

Continue to practice with what we have learned so far and build more functionality (or re-factor) the code
to learn more.

Have a fun, safe and healthy summer!
